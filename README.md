## Recipe- Assignment 3
line 2 changed remotely
 
This is an assignment for the UBC Key Capabilities in Data Science certificate in the Data Science Toolbox course. 

For the assignment, we practice git commands using a sample recipe. As I am currently replaying Stardew Valley and I love pink, Pink Cake is my recipe of choice. 

Enjoy!
